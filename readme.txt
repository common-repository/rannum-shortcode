Requires at least: 2.0.2
Tested up to: 3.1

Adds a shortcode for generating a random number, either 1-100 or in a set range.

== Description ==

RanNum is a free wordpress plugin that I created in response to needing the ability to randomize certain variables for a wordpress demo.

The plugin creates two shortcodes, “[ RN ]” and/or “[ RanNum ]“. Used as-is, these will each generate a random number from 1 to 100.

For further customization, however, you can set the range of the random number by setting “min” and “max” attributes inside the shortcode.

For instance, to generate a number between 5 and 200, use the shortcode


[RN min="5" max="200"]    

-or-   

[RanNum min="5" max="200"]






== Installation ==

Just upload using the “plugins > add new > upload” menu in the wordpress admin menu.

To install manually – simply download the zip file above, then upload the PHP file into a new folder within “wp-content/plugins/”, navigate to the plugins menu on your wordpress site and activate the ‘RanNum’ plugin, and presto! .
